Hello, sir. I have a question regarding the salary deduction for the month of May 2023.
RJIO and Veremax Management Services Pvt. Ltd. have a subcontract. Company has provided the NOC(Full and Final Settlement) form for closing the salary owing to contract being closed.

Veremax has been waiting for three months to pay their employees, but they have finally debited their take-home pay. and supported that with a formula.

Working for such a large organisation raises concerns that employers must endure excruciating agony in order to receive pay.
  needed assistance to receive the maximum wage
