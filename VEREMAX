Dear sir ,
  this is concern for the salary deduction of the month of may2023.
Veremax management services pvt lmt,. has Sub contract with RJIO. due to contract closed company has  provided the NOC(Full and final settlement) form for closing the salary .

From past three month waiting for the salary from veremax but finally they debited the take home salary from the employer . and justified that some formula .
its concern in working with such big organization , employer are suffering to get salary is very painful.
Required support to get the full salary
